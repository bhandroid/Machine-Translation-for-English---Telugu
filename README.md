# Machine-Translation-for-English---Telugu
Machine translation plays a key role in bridging the gaps between languages, especially for resource-rich languages like English and low-resource, morphologically complex languages like Telugu. Indeed, developing effective translation systems for such a language pair is challenging since there are significant differences in grammar, vocabulary, and syntactic structures. 
This project focuses on the development and improvement of MT at English↔Telugu. First, an encoderdecoder architecture at the word-level tokenization was implemented. The performance for this approach is analyzed with the BERTScore metric in detail, especially with respect to sentence length. After finding the deficiencies of the observed approach, a transformer-based mBART model was used.
